Hi! I’m Polina, a recent Engineering Physics graduate from the University of British Columbia. My interests include robotics, aerospace engineering, physics, and machine learning. I’ve worked on a number of cool projects, which you can check out [here](/projects/). My most recent project is an automated ballistic interceptor. Besides engineering, I enjoy hiking, reading and film photography.
