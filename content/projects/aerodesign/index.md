## Project Overview

I was a member of the [UBC AeroDesign](https://www.ubcaerodesign.com/) team, which designs and builds remote-controlled aircraft for the [SAE Aero Design competition](https://saeaerodesign.com/). As the Advanced Class fuselage subteam lead, I designed a portion of the fuselage in SolidWorks and wrote a Python script to perform aerodynamic constraint analysis and parameter optimization. This helped us identify parameters that would maximize our score at the competition.
