- Working in a startup environment

## Project Overview

The Autonomous Seed Interrogator was my first capstone project [(ENPH 459)](https://projectlab.engphys.ubc.ca/enph-459-479/). 
Working in a team of five, we developed a test-bench prototype for the Vancouver-based startup [Insporos](https://www.linkedin.com/company/insporos/?originalSubdomain=ca). The device automates the examination ("interrogation") of various vegetable seeds using RGB imaging and other sensors to detect diseases and abnormalities. More information about the projectâ€™s purpose and scope can be found in our project fair poster:

My contributions included automating the gantry system, implementing computer vision techniques, and developing a Python GUI software to control the prototype. This project was quite challenging because it was still in the exploratory phase, and so many variables were undefined. Nevertheless, it was a rewarding learning experience becuase I got to collaborate with a startup focused on addressing a real-world agricultural issue.
